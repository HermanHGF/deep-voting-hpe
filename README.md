# deep-voting-hpe
This is a Matlab + Caffe based implementation of the paper [Human Pose Estimation Using Deep Consensus Voting](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46475-6_16) by Ita Lifshitz, Ethan Fetaya and Shimon Ullman.

At the moment we only provide model trained on [MPII single person](http://human-pose.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) and code for deployment.
